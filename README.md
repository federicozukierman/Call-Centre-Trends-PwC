The task 🛠️

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Call Centre Manager is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

My solution 👨🏻‍💻

🟢Overall calls answered, abandoned, and resolved
🟢Calls sorted by topic
🟢Call volume per month
🟢Customer satisfaction rating
🟢Agent’s performance quadrant

As part of my PwC Virtual Internship, I created a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
